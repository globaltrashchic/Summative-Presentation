# Summative-Presentation

**_Good morning!_**

Here is my Summative Presentation. I have compiled three of my favourite works which in particular I enjoyed working most and some of them were challenging for me in my first term in Web Production. Some of the project needed some work to be done and this time I have put in effort to make it better for my presentation.

## Eye Bombing

Eye Bombing was our lesson's first group project. This was a task for us to take photographs of faces in unusual places. Having different ways of seeing and looking before creating in design. One thing I have learned from this project is the ability to look at what surrounds you and see the possibilities for how things can be framed. At the very least, they can transform the ugliest and most soulless places into things of beauty and humor. I decided to take a stroll to Portobello Market on my weekend to get some of the shots that I need.

### Someone's house along Portobello Road

I like how the placing and allignment of the windows and doors in this house. Which reminds me about placing things in grids for our web design.

## Union Hack

Union Hack was a project to teach us about about symbols and brands. We were given the task to redesigning flag which we will redevise the symbols to represent identities and convert ideas into shapes. For this particular project I have chosen the Japanese flag.

![The Japan Flag](https://github.com/globaltrashchic/Union-Hack/blob/master/sun01.gif)
The Japanese Flag is a white banner whose center contains a red circle; this circle represents the sun. The Japanese flag is called Hinomaru, which means "circle of the sun." In English it is sometimes called the "rising sun."
This flag has been used for over a thousand years, and no one knows who designed it or when. It was officially adopted as the flag of Imperial Japan on January 27, 1870.
