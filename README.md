# Summative-Presentation

**_Good morning!_**

Here is my Summative Presentation. I have compiled three of my favourite works which in particular I enjoyed working most and some of them were challenging for me in my first term in Web Production. Some of the project needed some work to be done and this time I have put in effort to make it better for my presentation.

## Eye Bombing

Eye Bombing was our lesson's first group project. This was a task for us to take photographs of faces in unusual places. Having different ways of seeing and looking before creating in design. One thing I have learned from this project is the ability to look at what surrounds you and see the possibilities for how things can be framed. At the very least, they can transform the ugliest and most soulless places into things of beauty and humor. I decided to take a stroll to Portobello Market on my weekend to get some of the shots that I need.

### Man Made Lamp which I found in a shop at the Portobello market.

### Someone's house along Portobello Road

I like how the placing and allignment of the windows and doors in this house. Which reminds me about placing things in grids for our web design.

## Union Hack

Union Hack was a project to teach us about about symbols and brands. We were given the task to redesign a flag which we will redevise the symbols to represent identities and convert ideas into shapes. For this particular project I have chosen the Japanese Flag.

![The Japan Flag](https://github.com/globaltrashchic/Union-Hack/blob/master/sun01.gif)

The Japanese Flag is a white banner whose center contains a red circle; this circle represents the sun, it is one of the easiest to recognize and enjoy due to its purity and simplicity. The Japanese flag is called Hinomaru, which means "Circle Of The Sun." In English it is sometimes called the "Rising Sun." This flag has been used for over a thousand years, and no one knows who designed it or when. It was officially adopted as the flag of Imperial Japan on January 27, 1870.

I removed the Red Circle in the centre and made a Rising Tone from it from yellow to red showing that the Sun is rising. The Warm colors include red, orange, and yellow, and variations of those three colors. These are the colors of fire, sunsets and sunrises, and are generally energizing, passionate, and positiv which in a way can sums up Japan's flag.

In this design, I replace the Red Cirle and Included the Map of Japan. The reason why I chose Red is to symbolize their country meaning for the Rising Sun.

Lastly my favourite flag, the above whereby I included a Samurai sword inside as part of the logo. The Samurai sword is a signature weapon that was inherited from Japan. The earliest origins of this fascinating weapons can be traced back some 1300 years ago. The first Japanese sword were basically variations of the Chinese Jian (called Chokuto) - in other words a straight, double edged iron blade. However sometime during the early Heian period, around 700AD, the first uniquely Japanese swords that were the forerunners of the 'modern' Katana began to evolve. It was during this time that Japan began to abandon such close cultural ties with China, it's society stabilized into class divisions, and the military guards of the capital and the gentlemen of the provinces became the first Samurai. I chose the color Black which is associated with power, elegance, formality and mystery. Black is a mysterious color associated with fear and the unknown.
