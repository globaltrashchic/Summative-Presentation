# Summative-Presentation

**Good morning. Welcome to my Summative Presentation, I have compiled three of my favourite works which in particular I enjoyed working on and some of them were challenging for me in my first term in Web Production.**

## Eye Bombing

**This was a project for us to photographs faces in unusual places. Having different ways of seeing and looking before creating. One thing I have learned from this project is the ability to look at what surrounds you and see the possibilities for how things can be framed
At the very least, they can transform the ugliest and most soulless places into things of beauty and humor.**
