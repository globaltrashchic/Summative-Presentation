# Summative-Presentation

**_Good morning._**

Here is my Summative Presentation. I have compiled three of my favourite works which in particular I enjoyed working most and some of them were challenging for me in my first term in Web Production. Some of the project needed some work to be done and this time I have put in effort to make it better for my presentation.

## Eye Bombing

Eye Bombing was our lesson's first group project. This was a task for us to take photographs of faces in unusual places. Having different ways of seeing and looking before creating in design. One thing I have learned from this project is the ability to look at what surrounds you and see the possibilities for how things can be framed. At the very least, they can transform the ugliest and most soulless places into things of beauty and humor. I decided to take a stroll to Portobello Market on my weekend to get some of the shots that I need.
